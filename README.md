# SteepestDescent
The method of steepest descent often referred to as Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to minimize a function. Its like finding the lowest point in a hilly terrain. We will need an objective function which needs to be minimized. The we will take negative of the gradient and perform iterations using a learning rate.
