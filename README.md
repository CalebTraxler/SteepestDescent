# SteepestDescent
The method of steepest descent often referred to as Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used to minimize a function. Its like finding the lowest point in a hilly terrain. We will need an objective function which needs to be minimized. The we will take negative of the gradient and perform iterations using a learning rate. 
Note that you will need to change a couple hyperparameters, including the learning rate, the max number of iterations, the tolerance, etc. 
You will also need to input your own function. You will need to take the jacobian of the function, including all of the respective partial derivatives. 
This program works for multidimensional functions, however you will need to change n respectively.
